        <h2 class="main_topic_headings">Technologies related with AMP</h2>
        <p>Both these technologies are aimed at improving mobile web browsing</p>
        <dl class="section_padding">
            <dt>PWA</dt>
            <dd>PWA - Progressive Web apps that are built using basic web technologies such as HTML, CSS and
                JavaScript is designed to work like a normal mobile app. It is also responsive and adapts to the
                screen size and can be added to the home screen of the user. Both AMP and PWA improve mobile web
                browsing but PWA gives users an app-like experience.
            </dd>
            <dt>Facebook Instant articles</dt>
            <dd>Instant Articles is a feature of Meta that allows users to create content that loads
                fast within the Facebook application on mobile devices. This is done by optimizing the user content
                for
                mobile devices. While AMP and instant articles improve mobile browsing, this technology is used to
                create an app-like user experience</dd>
        </dl>






        <h2 class="main_topic_headings">Management of AMP</h2>
        <p class="section_padding">AMP was developed by AMP project which is owned by Google, which has control over it.
            Therefore it could be said that AMP is managed by Google.

    <section id="aside_section">

        <h2 class="main_topic_headings">Future of AMP</h2>

        <aside>AMP has reached a stage where it provides speed at no cost to the user experience, but it doesn't
            seem to have the game-changing updates that it once did, therefore in the future it may remain as
            just another choice
            to optimize mobile webpages, although it may keep improving.</aside>
        <p>Due to controversies surrounding AMP, such as the control over it by Google and restrictions on design, it
            may
            cause some developers to reconsider using it in the future.
            Furthermore with the introduction of Core web vitals by Google in 2021, which is a much better technique than
            AMP it could be said that the glory days of AMP are behind, and developers.
